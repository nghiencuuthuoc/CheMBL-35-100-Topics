ðŸ§© Topic: Merging ChEMBL with PubChem CID data
---
Okay, I understand. You're working on a ChEMBL 35 data analysis project using RDKit, following an AIMLops-inspired directory structure. You're running PostgreSQL (psql) on a remote server (192.168.206.136) and want guidance on executing your code within the defined framework, specifically addressing the errors you've encountered. I'll provide a clear analysis, SQL and Python code snippets, and examples, focusing on extracting a manageable 100-row sample.

Let's break down the problem and create the solution.

**1. Analysis of the Analysis Model**

Your analysis likely involves querying the ChEMBL database, extracting relevant information (e.g., activity data), cleaning/transforming the data, and potentially building predictive models (though you haven't explicitly stated this).  Key aspects include:

*   **Data Extraction:** This involves SQL queries to select specific tables and columns from the ChEMBL database (e.g., `activities`, `molecule_dictionary`, `assays`).
*   **Filtering:** You need to filter the data based on relevant criteria. This includes filtering based on activity type (e.g., IC50), target, assay type, and potency.
*   **Data Cleaning and Transformation:** This includes handling missing values, converting units, and standardizing data formats.  The error you encountered suggests issues with data type inconsistencies (e.g., trying to use a regular expression on a numeric column).
*   **RDKit Integration:** This involves using RDKit to manipulate molecule structures (e.g., generate fingerprints, calculate descriptors).
*   **Modeling (Optional):** If you're building a predictive model, you'll need to select appropriate algorithms, train the model, and evaluate its performance.  The scikit-learn error indicates you need to handle version compatibility.

**2. Addressing the Errors**

*   **SQL Error:** `"ERROR: operator does not exist: numeric ~ unknown, LINE 12: AND act.standard_value ~ '^[0-9\.]+$'"`
    *   **Cause:** This error occurs because you're trying to use a regular expression operator (`~`) on a column (`act.standard_value`) that PostgreSQL has identified as a numeric type (likely `integer` or `numeric`). Regular expressions are for text-based data.
    *   **Solution:** You need to either:
        1.  Cast the column to text: `CAST(act.standard_value AS TEXT) ~ '^[0-9\.]+$'`
        2.  Use numeric comparison operators: `act.standard_value >= 0` (if you're just checking for non-negative values)

*   **Python/Scikit-learn Error:** `"old scikit-learn version does not support parameters squared=False in the mean_squared_error function"`
    *   **Cause:** You're using an older version of scikit-learn that doesn't support the `squared=False` parameter in `mean_squared_error`.  This parameter controls whether the function returns the Mean Squared Error (MSE) or the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
    *   **Solution:**
        1.  **Upgrade Scikit-learn (Recommended):** `pip install -U scikit-learn`
        2.  **Calculate RMSE Manually (Workaround):** If upgrading isn't an option, calculate the RMSE by taking the square root of the MSE.

**3. SQL Code (Topic_CheMBL_35_82.sql)**

```sql
-- SQL query to extract data and save as CSV
-- Get 100 random activities related to specific target
-- Modify the WHERE clause based on your topic of interest

SELECT
    md.chembl_id,
    act.standard_type,
    act.standard_value,
    act.standard_units,
    act.pchembl_value
FROM
    activities act
JOIN
    molecule_dictionary md ON act.molregno = md.molregno
JOIN
    target_dictionary td ON act.tid = td.tid
WHERE
    td.target_name LIKE '%Kinase%' -- Example: Filter by target name
    AND act.standard_type = 'IC50'   -- Example: Filter by activity type
    AND act.standard_units = 'nM'     -- Example: Filter by activity units
    AND CAST(act.standard_value AS TEXT) ~ '^[0-9\.]+$'  -- Filter numeric values, fix SQL error here. Cast to text for regex or use numeric comparison.
ORDER BY random()
LIMIT 100;

-- Save the result of the above query to a CSV file
-- In pgAdmin, right-click on the query result and select "Copy with Headers"
-- Paste the data into a text file and save it as Topic_CheMBL_35_82.csv in the ../data/ folder.
```

**Important:** Execute this SQL code in pgAdmin, then *manually* copy the results (including headers) and paste them into a file named `Topic_CheMBL_35_82.csv` located in your `../data/` directory. pgAdmin doesn't directly save to a file; you must copy and paste.

**4. Python Code (Topic_CheMBL_35_82_1_Data_Loading.ipynb)**

```python
# Topic_CheMBL_35_82_1_Data_Loading.ipynb

import os
import pandas as pd

# Define the base path
base_path = os.path.abspath(os.path.join(os.getcwd(), "..")) # Go up one level from the notebook directory
data_path = os.path.join(base_path, "data")
csv_file = os.path.join(data_path, "Topic_CheMBL_35_82.csv")

print(f"Base path: {base_path}")
print(f"Data path: {data_path}")
print(f"CSV file path: {csv_file}")

# Load the data using pandas
try:
    df = pd.read_csv(csv_file)
    print(f"Data loaded successfully from {csv_file}")
    print(df.head())  # Display the first few rows
except FileNotFoundError:
    print(f"Error: File not found at {csv_file}.  Make sure you saved the CSV from pgAdmin to the correct location.")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"An error occurred while loading the data: {e}")
```

**5. Python Code (Topic_CheMBL_35_82_2_Data_Analysis.ipynb)**

```python
# Topic_CheMBL_35_82_2_Data_Analysis.ipynb

import os
import pandas as pd
from rdkit import Chem
from rdkit.Chem import AllChem
import numpy as np
#from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split # Remove if not modeling
#from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression # Remove if not modeling
#from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error # Remove if not modeling

# Define the base path and data path
base_path = os.path.abspath(os.path.join(os.getcwd(), ".."))
data_path = os.path.join(base_path, "data")
csv_file = os.path.join(data_path, "Topic_CheMBL_35_82.csv")

# Load the data
try:
    df = pd.read_csv(csv_file)
except FileNotFoundError:
    print(f"Error: File not found at {csv_file}.  Make sure you saved the CSV from pgAdmin to the correct location.")
    exit() # Stop execution
except Exception as e:
    print(f"An error occurred while loading the data: {e}")
    exit() # Stop execution

# Display data info
print("Dataframe Info:")
print(df.info())

# Handle missing pchembl_value (replace NaN with 0 for demonstration)
df['pchembl_value'] = df['pchembl_value'].fillna(0) # Or remove rows with NaN

# Example: Create RDKit Mol objects
def create_mol(chembl_id):
  """Dummy function to simulate fetching molecules using chembl_id"""
  # Normally, you'd query ChEMBL API here
  # For the sake of demonstration, we create a simple molecule
  smiles = 'CC(=O)Oc1ccccc1C(=O)O' # Aspirin SMILES
  mol = Chem.MolFromSmiles(smiles)
  return mol

df['ROMol'] = [create_mol(chembl_id) for chembl_id in df['chembl_id']]
df = df[df['ROMol'].notna()]

# Example: Calculate Morgan Fingerprints
def calculate_morgan_fingerprint(mol):
    try:
        info = {}
        fp = AllChem.GetMorganFingerprint(mol, 2, bitInfo=info) # Radius of 2
        return fp
    except:
        return None

df['MorganFP'] = df['ROMol'].apply(calculate_morgan_fingerprint)
df = df[df['MorganFP'].notna()]

print(df.head())

# Example of regression calculation (if you have proper features and target variables)
# Make sure there are at least 2 unique non-NaN values in the target column to split it
#if df['pchembl_value'].nunique() > 1:
#   X = df['MorganFP'].tolist() # Example Feature (Morgan fingerprints)
#   y = df['pchembl_value'].tolist()  # Target variable
#
#   X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
#
#   # Model Building
#   model = LinearRegression()
#   model.fit(X_train, y_train)
#   y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
#
#   # Calculate Mean Squared Error (MSE) or Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
#   mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)
#   rmse = np.sqrt(mse) # Calculate RMSE if MSE is not available

# Example Output
print("Completed data analysis")
```

**Explanation and Key Points:**

*   **AIMLops Compliance:**  The `os.path.join(base_path, ...)` calls ensure your code works correctly regardless of the current working directory, which is crucial for a robust AIMLops setup.  The notebook names follow your specified pattern.
*   **Error Handling:** The `try...except` blocks are essential for catching potential errors, like the CSV file not being found.  This makes your code more resilient.
*   **SQL Error Correction:**  The `CAST(act.standard_value AS TEXT) ~ '^[0-9\.]+$'` line in the SQL query addresses the `numeric ~ unknown` error by explicitly casting the `standard_value` column to text before applying the regular expression.  Alternatively, you can use numeric comparisons (e.g., `act.standard_value >= 0`).
*   **Scikit-learn Error:** If you cannot upgrade scikit-learn, uncomment the calculation of RMSE manually and replace the function parameter squared = False.
*   **RDKit Integration:** The example code demonstrates how to load molecules using RDKit and calculate Morgan fingerprints.  **Important:**  The `create_mol` function is a placeholder.  You'll need to replace it with code that actually fetches molecules from the ChEMBL database based on the `chembl_id`.  This might involve using the ChEMBL API. If you cannot access the ChEMBL database, you can replace the dummy molecule "Aspirin" with other known molecules.
*   **Fingerprint generation** is included to show that the code is capable of processing data with rdkit
*   **Data Filtering** Filtering is included to ensure that molecules are valid and usable
*   **Regression Example:**  The commented-out regression code shows how you *could* build a simple model. However, **you will need to adapt this based on your actual features and target variable.**  The code also includes an example of how to calculate the RMSE manually if your scikit-learn version is old. Remember to uncomment the import statements (`from sklearn.model_selection...`) if you use the regression example.
*   **CSV Loading:**  Pay very close attention to the `csv_file` path. Double-check that the CSV file is actually located in that directory.
*   **Install RDKit:** `conda install -c conda-forge rdkit`
*   **SQL Manual Copy:** You **must** copy the data from pgAdmin and save it as a CSV manually.  pgAdmin doesn't have a built-in "save to CSV" feature like some other database tools.
*   **Install pandas**`pip install pandas`
*  **Install scikit-learn**`pip install scikit-learn`

**6. Examples**

Here are five examples of how you might adapt the SQL query and Python code to focus on different research areas within ChEMBL.  Remember to modify the `WHERE` clause in the SQL query and adapt the Python code accordingly.

1.  **Example 1:  Specific Target Family (Kinases)**

    *   **SQL:**

    ```sql
    WHERE
        td.target_name LIKE '%Kinase%'
        AND act.standard_type = 'IC50'
        AND act.standard_units = 'nM'
        AND CAST(act.standard_value AS TEXT) ~ '^[0-9\.]+$'
    ```

    *   **Python:** Analyze the activities of compounds against kinases.  You might calculate descriptors specific to kinase inhibitors.

2.  **Example 2:  Specific Protein Target (e.g., EGFR)**

    *   **SQL:**

    ```sql
    WHERE
        td.target_name LIKE '%EGFR%'
        AND act.standard_type = 'IC50'
        AND act.standard_units = 'nM'
        AND CAST(act.standard_value AS TEXT) ~ '^[0-9\.]+$'
    ```

    *   **Python:**  Focus on compounds targeting EGFR (Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor). You could explore structure-activity relationships (SAR) around known EGFR inhibitors.

3.  **Example 3:  Specific Activity Type (e.g., Ki)**

    *   **SQL:**

    ```sql
    WHERE
        act.standard_type = 'Ki'
        AND act.standard_units = 'nM'
        AND CAST(act.standard_value AS TEXT) ~ '^[0-9\.]+$'
    ```

    *   **Python:**  Analyze compounds with Ki (inhibition constant) data. You might compare Ki values to IC50 values for the same compounds.

4.  **Example 4:  Specific Assay Type (e.g., Binding Assay)**

    *   **SQL:**

    ```sql
    JOIN assays a ON act.assay_id = a.assay_id
    WHERE
        a.assay_type = 'B' -- 'B' likely represents binding assay
        AND act.standard_type = 'IC50'
        AND act.standard_units = 'nM'
        AND CAST(act.standard_value AS TEXT) ~ '^[0-9\.]+$'
    ```

    *   **Python:**  Analyze data from binding assays. You could investigate the correlation between binding affinity and cellular activity.

5.  **Example 5:  Focus on High-Potency Compounds (IC50 < 100 nM)**

    *   **SQL:**

    ```sql
    WHERE
        act.standard_type = 'IC50'
        AND act.standard_units = 'nM'
        AND act.standard_value < 100
    ```

    *   **Python:**  Identify and analyze the structures of highly potent compounds.  You could look for common structural features or pharmacophores.

**Remember to adapt the Python code within the notebooks to perform the specific analysis relevant to each example.**

**Important Considerations:**

*   **ChEMBL API:** For more robust and scalable data retrieval, consider using the ChEMBL API instead of directly querying the database.  This is especially important if you need to access more than just a small subset of the data.
*   **Data Validation:** Always validate the data you extract from ChEMBL.  Check for inconsistencies, errors, and potential biases.
*   **Units Conversion:** Be very careful with units. Ensure that all activity values are in the same units before performing any calculations.
*   **Reproducibility:**  Document your code and analysis thoroughly so that your results can be easily reproduced.
