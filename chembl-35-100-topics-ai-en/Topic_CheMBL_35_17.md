🧩 Topic: Mining kinase inhibitors from ChEMBL
---
Okay, I understand. As a Pharmaceutical Research and Development Specialist, I can help you structure your Chembl 35 data analysis project and address the errors you've encountered. Let's break this down into SQL and Python code, adhering to the AIMLops template and your specific requirements.

**1. Analysis Model**

The project revolves around analyzing ChEMBL 35 data to identify potential drug candidates. Your current workflow involves:

*   **Data Extraction (SQL):** Querying the ChEMBL 35 database to retrieve relevant bioactivity data.  This involves filtering bioactivities based on specific criteria like target, assay type, and activity type (e.g., IC50). You'll save the results as a CSV file.
*   **Data Processing and Analysis (Python):** Using RDKit for molecular processing (e.g., calculating molecular properties, generating fingerprints) and potentially scikit-learn for building predictive models (e.g., Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship or QSAR models).

**Specific Challenges Addressed:**

*   **SQL `numeric ~ unknown` error:** This arises when you're trying to use a regular expression ( `~` operator) on a numeric column. PostgreSQL is trying to implicitly cast the `standard_value` to text for the regex comparison, and that process fails with numerics. Solution: Explicitly cast `standard_value` to `TEXT` or use numeric comparison.
*   **`squared=False` error in scikit-learn:** Your scikit-learn version is outdated.  Solution: Either upgrade scikit-learn or use the `mean_squared_error` function without the `squared` parameter (if you don't need the Root Mean Squared Error).

**General workflow consideration**

*   It's essential to define the specific research question you're trying to answer with this data. For example:
    *   "Can we predict the activity (e.g., IC50) of a molecule against a specific target using its molecular properties?"
    *   "What are the key molecular features that correlate with high activity against a particular target?"

    Having a clear research question will guide your feature selection, model choice, and evaluation metrics.

**2. Code Examples (SQL and Python)**

Let's assume your `base_path` is defined as follows:

```python
import os

base_path = "./" # Or a more specific path, such as "/path/to/your/project"
data_path = os.path.join(base_path, "data")
notebook_path = os.path.join(base_path, "notebooks")
os.makedirs(data_path, exist_ok=True)  # Create the data directory if it doesn't exist
os.makedirs(notebook_path, exist_ok=True) # Create the notebooks directory if it doesn't exist
```

**SQL Code (Topic\_CheMBL\_35\_17.sql - saved in `../data/` folder via pgAdmin)**

```sql
-- Connect to the chembl_35 database
\c chembl_35

-- Extract bioactivity data for a specific target (example: Target ID CHEMBL205 - Tyrosine-protein kinase ABL1)
-- Limiting to 100 rows for demonstration purposes

SELECT
    act.molregno,
    act.standard_value,
    act.standard_units,
    act.standard_type,
    md.chembl_id AS molecule_chembl_id,
    td.chembl_id AS target_chembl_id
FROM
    activities act
JOIN
    molecule_dictionary md ON act.molregno = md.molregno
JOIN
    target_dictionary td ON act.tid = td.tid
WHERE
    td.chembl_id = 'CHEMBL205'  -- Example: Target ID for Tyrosine-protein kinase ABL1
    AND act.standard_type = 'IC50' -- Filter for IC50 values
    AND act.standard_units = 'nM'  -- Filter for nM units
    AND act.standard_value IS NOT NULL
    AND act.standard_value > 0      --Avoid zero values

    --Explicitly cast standard_value to TEXT to avoid the numeric ~ unknown error. alternative we can use act.standard_value >= 0
    AND act.standard_value::TEXT ~ '^[0-9\.]+$'

ORDER BY act.standard_value ASC
LIMIT 100;

-- Save the results to a CSV file (you'll do this manually through pgAdmin)
-- Export the result of the query as CSV from pgAdmin directly into data folder
```

**Important:** After running the SQL query, use pgAdmin's export feature to save the results as `Topic_CheMBL_35_17.csv` in the `data` directory ( `../data/Topic_CheMBL_35_17.csv` ).

**3. Five Examples (Use Cases)**

Here are five examples of how you might use this analysis pipeline:

1.  **Target Prioritization:** Identify targets with a large number of high-affinity compounds (e.g., low IC50 values).  This can help prioritize targets for further investigation.

    *   **SQL:** Modify the SQL query to group by `target_chembl_id` and count the number of activities below a certain `standard_value`.

2.  **Lead Discovery:**  Screen a virtual library of compounds against a specific target and predict their activity using the QSAR model.

    *   **Python:** Load the trained QSAR model and use it to predict the activity of new compounds based on their calculated fingerprints.

3.  **Hit-to-Lead Optimization:**  Identify structural modifications to improve the activity of a lead compound.

    *   **Python:**  Generate a series of analogs (using RDKit's scaffold hopping or fragment replacement methods) and predict their activity using the QSAR model.

4.  **Off-Target Prediction:**  Predict the activity of a compound against a panel of targets to identify potential off-target effects.

    *   **SQL & Python:**  Extend the SQL query to retrieve data for multiple targets.  Train separate QSAR models for each target and use them to predict the activity of a compound against the entire panel.

5.  **QSAR Model Improvement:** Evaluate the QSAR model performance, refine the features, and try different machine-learning algorithms.

    *   **Python:**  Experiment with different molecular descriptors (e.g., constitutional, topological, electronic) and machine-learning algorithms (e.g., Support Vector Machines, Neural Networks).  Use cross-validation to evaluate the model's performance and hyperparameter optimization techniques (e.g., GridSearchCV) to find the best model configuration.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **SMILES retrieval:** The provided code includes placeholders for fetching SMILES strings.  You'll need to implement the appropriate method for retrieving SMILES from the ChEMBL database or another source.  Consider creating a separate table that links `molregno` to SMILES.
*   **Feature Selection:**  Experiment with different molecular descriptors and feature selection techniques to improve the QSAR model's performance.
*   **Model Validation:**  Rigorous model validation is crucial.  Use techniques like cross-validation, y-randomization, and external validation to ensure the model's reliability and predictive power.
*   **Data scaling:** It might be beneficial to scale features before training the model. This can improve the performance of some machine learning algorithms.

**In summary (English and Chinese):**

**English:** This structured approach, incorporating SQL for data extraction and Python with RDKit for analysis, will allow you to efficiently work with ChEMBL 35 data. Addressing the specific errors mentioned and focusing on a clear research question are key to a successful project. Remember to thoroughly validate your QSAR models.
