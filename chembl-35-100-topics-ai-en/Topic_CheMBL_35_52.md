🧩 Topic: Oncology-focused drug trend in ChEMBL
---
Okay, I understand. You're working on a ChEMBL 35 data analysis project using RDKit and need guidance on how to structure your code, run queries, handle potential errors, and create examples, following an AIMLops template and addressing specific SQL and Python issues. Let's break this down step by step.

**1. Analysis of the Analysis Model**

Given that you're using ChEMBL data and RDKit, the overall goal is likely to explore relationships between chemical structures and biological activity.  Here's a general model framework:

*   **Data Extraction & Preparation (SQL):** Retrieve relevant data from ChEMBL, focusing on activity data (IC50, Ki, etc.) and associated chemical structures (SMILES). Clean the data, handle missing values, and standardize units. Limiting to 100 rows for initial development is smart.
*   **Feature Engineering (Python/RDKit):**  Use RDKit to generate molecular descriptors (e.g., molecular weight, LogP, number of hydrogen bond donors/acceptors, topological polar surface area (TPSA), etc.) from the SMILES strings. These descriptors become the features for your analysis.
*   **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) (Python):**  Explore the data, looking for correlations between descriptors and activity values.  This can involve scatter plots, histograms, and other visualizations.
*   **Modeling (Python/Scikit-learn):** Build a predictive model to relate the molecular descriptors to the activity values.  Common choices include:
    *   **Linear Regression:** Simple, but can be a good starting point.
    *   **Random Forest:** Robust and can capture non-linear relationships.
    *   **Support Vector Machines (SVM):** Can be effective with high-dimensional data.
    *   **Neural Networks:** More complex, but can learn intricate patterns.
*   **Evaluation (Python):** Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics such as:
    *   **Mean Squared Error (MSE):**  Measures the average squared difference between predicted and actual values.
    *   **R-squared:**  Represents the proportion of variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variables.
    *   **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE):** The square root of MSE, easier to interpret.
    *   **Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC):** For classification problems (e.g., active/inactive).
*   **Interpretation (Python):**  Analyze the model to understand which descriptors are most important for predicting activity.

**2. SQL and Python Code**

Here's the code, incorporating the error handling and row limit.

**SQL (`../data/chembl_35_52_data.sql`):**

```sql
-- Extracting 100 rows of data for ChEMBL_35_52 analysis.
-- Focuses on activity data and associated SMILES strings.

SELECT
    act.molregno,
    act.standard_value,
    act.standard_units,
    act.standard_type,
    md.chembl_id,
    md.canonical_smiles
FROM
    activities act
JOIN
    molecule_dictionary md ON act.molregno = md.molregno
WHERE
    act.standard_type = 'IC50'  -- Focus on IC50 values
    AND act.standard_units = 'nM' -- Standardize units to nM
    AND act.standard_value IS NOT NULL
    AND md.canonical_smiles IS NOT NULL
    AND act.standard_value::text ~ '^[0-9\.]+$'  -- Corrected: Use ::text for regex matching
LIMIT 100;

-- Save the result to a CSV file using pgAdmin's export feature.
```

**Explanation:**

*   **`SELECT ... FROM activities act JOIN molecule_dictionary md ...`:**  This selects the necessary columns (activity data and SMILES strings) from the `activities` and `molecule_dictionary` tables, joining them on `molregno`.
*   **`WHERE ...`:** This filters the data to include only:
    *   IC50 values (`act.standard_type = 'IC50'`).
    *   Values in nM (`act.standard_units = 'nM'`).
    *   Non-null values for both activity and SMILES.
    *   **`AND act.standard_value::text ~ '^[0-9\.]+$'`:** This is the corrected version of your regex.  The error `operator does not exist: numeric ~ unknown` arises because the `~` operator (regex match) in PostgreSQL typically works with text data.  By casting `act.standard_value` to text (`act.standard_value::text`), you resolve this issue.  The regex `^[0-9\.]+$` ensures that the `standard_value` contains only digits and periods.
*   **`LIMIT 100`:**  Limits the output to 100 rows.

**Important:**  After running this SQL query in pgAdmin, use pgAdmin's export feature (usually right-click on the results and select "Copy" or "Save as CSV") to save the results to a CSV file named `chembl_35_52_data.csv` in your `../data/` directory.

**Python Code (`notebooks/Topic_CheMBL_35_52_1_data_preparation.ipynb`):**

```python
import os
import pandas as pd
from rdkit import Chem
from rdkit.Chem import Descriptors
import numpy as np

# Define base path for AIMLops structure
base_path = ".."  # Assuming the notebook is one level down from the base directory
data_path = os.path.join(base_path, "data", "chembl_35_52_data.csv")

# Load data
try:
    df = pd.read_csv(data_path)
except FileNotFoundError:
    print(f"Error: File not found at {data_path}.  Make sure you've saved the CSV from pgAdmin.")
    exit()

print(f"Loaded {len(df)} rows from {data_path}")
print(df.head())

# Function to calculate molecular descriptors using RDKit
def calculate_descriptors(smiles):
    try:
        mol = Chem.MolFromSmiles(smiles)
        if mol is None:
            return None
        descriptors = {}
        descriptors['MolWt'] = Descriptors.MolWt(mol)
        descriptors['LogP'] = Descriptors.MolLogP(mol)
        descriptors['HBD'] = Descriptors.NumHDonors(mol)
        descriptors['HBA'] = Descriptors.NumHAcceptors(mol)
        descriptors['TPSA'] = Descriptors.TPSA(mol)
        return descriptors
    except:
        return None

# Apply descriptor calculation
df['descriptors'] = df['canonical_smiles'].apply(calculate_descriptors)
df = df.dropna(subset=['descriptors']) # Drop rows where descriptor calculation failed
df = df.join(pd.DataFrame(df.pop('descriptors').values.tolist(), index=df.index)) # Expand the descriptor column

print(df.head())

# Basic statistics
print(df[['standard_value', 'MolWt', 'LogP', 'HBD', 'HBA', 'TPSA']].describe())

# Save the processed data (optional)
processed_data_path = os.path.join(base_path, "data", "chembl_35_52_processed.csv")
df.to_csv(processed_data_path, index=False)
print(f"Processed data saved to {processed_data_path}")
```

**Python Code (`notebooks/Topic_CheMBL_35_52_2_modeling.ipynb`):**

```python
import os
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error, r2_score
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

# Define base path
base_path = ".."
processed_data_path = os.path.join(base_path, "data", "chembl_35_52_processed.csv")

# Load the processed data
try:
    df = pd.read_csv(processed_data_path)
except FileNotFoundError:
    print(f"Error: File not found at {processed_data_path}.  Make sure you've run the data preparation notebook.")
    exit()

# Prepare data for modeling
df = df.dropna(subset=['standard_value', 'MolWt', 'LogP', 'HBD', 'HBA', 'TPSA']) # Remove rows with missing values (important!)
X = df[['MolWt', 'LogP', 'HBD', 'HBA', 'TPSA']]
y = df['standard_value']

# Data scaling
scaler = StandardScaler()
X_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X)

# Split data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X_scaled, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Train a linear regression model
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate the model
mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)
r2 = r2_score(y_test, y_pred)

print(f"Mean Squared Error: {mse}")
print(f"R-squared: {r2}")

# Example prediction
example_index = 0
example_features = X_test[example_index]
predicted_value = model.predict(X_test[example_index].reshape(1, -1))[0]
actual_value = y_test.iloc[example_index]

print(f"Example: Predicted IC50: {predicted_value:.2f}, Actual IC50: {actual_value:.2f}")

```

**Explanation:**

*   **`os.path.join(base_path, ...)`:**  Uses `os.path.join` to construct file paths, making the code more robust to different directory structures.  This is essential for AIMLops.
*   **`try...except FileNotFoundError`:**  Handles the case where the CSV file is not found, providing a more informative error message.
*   **RDKit Descriptor Calculation:** The `calculate_descriptors` function calculates several important molecular descriptors using RDKit.  It also includes error handling (`try...except`) in case RDKit encounters issues with a particular SMILES string. If mol is None the descriptor can't be calculated.
*   **Data Cleaning:** `df = df.dropna(subset=['descriptors'])` removes any rows where descriptor calculation failed.  This is crucial because RDKit might not be able to process every SMILES string.
*   **Modeling:** Uses `sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression` for a basic regression model.  You can easily replace this with other models like `RandomForestRegressor` or `SVR`.
*   **`mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)`:** Calculates the mean squared error.
*   **`train_test_split`:** Splits the data into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data.
*   **`StandardScaler`:** Scales the features to have zero mean and unit variance, which can improve the performance of some machine learning algorithms.
*   **Example Prediction:** Added an example prediction to show how to use the model to predict the IC50 value for a single compound.

**Addressing the `squared=False` Error:**

The error `old scikit-learn version does not support parameters squared=False in the mean_squared_error function` indicates that you are using an older version of scikit-learn. The `squared=False` parameter was added in a later version to allow for the direct calculation of Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

**Solution:**

1.  **Upgrade Scikit-learn:**  The best solution is to upgrade your scikit-learn version.  In your Jupyter Notebook or terminal, run:

    ```bash
    pip install -U scikit-learn
    ```

    or

    ```bash
    conda update scikit-learn
    ```

    Then restart your Jupyter Notebook kernel to ensure the updated version is loaded.

2.  **Calculate RMSE Manually (if upgrading is not possible):**  If you absolutely cannot upgrade scikit-learn (e.g., due to environment constraints), you can calculate RMSE manually:

    ```python
    from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error
    import numpy as np

    mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)
    rmse = np.sqrt(mse)  # Calculate RMSE manually
    print(f"Root Mean Squared Error: {rmse}")
    ```

**3. AIMLops Structure Considerations**

Your folder structure is a good starting point for AIMLops. Here's a more detailed suggestion:

```
Topic_CheMBL_35_52/
├── data/               # Raw data (CSV from SQL) and processed data
│   ├── chembl_35_52_data.csv
│   └── chembl_35_52_processed.csv
├── notebooks/          # Jupyter notebooks for exploration, analysis, and modeling
│   ├── Topic_CheMBL_35_52_1_data_preparation.ipynb
│   └── Topic_CheMBL_35_52_2_modeling.ipynb
├── models/             # Saved model files (e.g., pickled scikit-learn models)
│   └── linear_regression_model.pkl
├── scripts/            # Python scripts for reusable functions or pipelines
│   └── feature_engineering.py
├── reports/            # Generated reports (e.g., HTML, PDF)
│   └── model_performance_report.html
├── sql/                # SQL scripts
│   └── chembl_35_52_data.sql
├── README.md           # Project description and instructions
└── requirements.txt   # List of Python dependencies

```

**Key AIMLops Principles Reflected in this Structure:**

*   **Reproducibility:**  The `requirements.txt` file ensures that anyone can recreate your environment and run your code.  The SQL scripts are also version-controlled.
*   **Modularity:**  Breaking the code into notebooks and scripts promotes modularity and reusability.
*   **Data Versioning (Implicit):** While you're not explicitly versioning the data files, you *are* versioning the SQL script that generates them.  This provides a degree of traceability.  For true data versioning, consider tools like DVC (Data Version Control).
*   **Experiment Tracking:**  Although not explicitly shown here, you could use tools like MLflow to track different model runs, parameters, and metrics.  This helps you manage and compare experiments.

**4. Five Examples**

Here are five examples of things you can do with this framework:

1.  **Different Regression Models:**  Replace the `LinearRegression` model with `RandomForestRegressor` or `SVR` (Support Vector Regression) and compare their performance.  Experiment with hyperparameters for each model.

    ```python
    from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor

    model = RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)  # Example hyperparameters
    model.fit(X_train, y_train)
    y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
    mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)
    r2 = r2_score(y_test, y_pred)
    print(f"Random Forest - Mean Squared Error: {mse}")
    print(f"Random Forest - R-squared: {r2}")
    ```

2.  **Feature Selection:**  Use feature selection techniques (e.g., SelectKBest, Recursive Feature Elimination) to identify the most important descriptors for predicting activity.  This can simplify your model and improve its interpretability.

    ```python
    from sklearn.feature_selection import SelectKBest, f_regression

    selector = SelectKBest(score_func=f_regression, k=3)  # Select top 3 features
    X_new = selector.fit_transform(X_scaled, y_train)
    print("Selected feature indices:", selector.get_support(indices=True))
    # Train a model using X_new instead of X_scaled
    ```

3.  **Different Activity Types:**  Modify the SQL query to extract data for a different activity type (e.g., Ki, EC50) instead of IC50.  You'll need to adjust the `WHERE` clause in the SQL query.

    ```sql
    WHERE
        act.standard_type = 'Ki'  -- Changed to Ki
        AND act.standard_units = 'nM'
        AND act.standard_value IS NOT NULL
        AND md.canonical_smiles IS NOT NULL
        AND act.standard_value::text ~ '^[0-9\.]+$'
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

4.  **Substructure Search:**  Use RDKit to perform a substructure search.  For example, find all compounds that contain a specific chemical fragment.

    ```python
    from rdkit import Chem
    from rdkit.Chem import Draw

    # Define a SMARTS pattern for the substructure
    substructure_smarts = 'c1ccccc1'  # Example: Benzene ring
    substructure = Chem.MolFromSmarts(substructure_smarts)

    # Find compounds containing the substructure
    matches = df['canonical_smiles'].apply(lambda smiles: Chem.MolFromSmiles(smiles).HasSubstructMatch(substructure) if Chem.MolFromSmiles(smiles) else False)
    df_with_substructure = df[matches]
    print(f"Number of compounds with substructure: {len(df_with_substructure)}")

    # Visualize the first few compounds with the substructure
    if not df_with_substructure.empty:
        mols = [Chem.MolFromSmiles(smiles) for smiles in df_with_substructure['canonical_smiles'].head(3)]
        img = Draw.MolsToGridImage(mols, highlightAtomLists=[mol.GetSubstructMatch(substructure) for mol in mols], molsPerRow=3)
        img  # Display the image (in a Jupyter Notebook)
    ```

5.  **Clustering:** Use clustering algorithms (e.g., k-means) to group compounds based on their molecular descriptors. This can help you identify clusters of compounds with similar activity.

    ```python
    from sklearn.cluster import KMeans
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

    # Choose the number of clusters
    n_clusters = 5

    # Apply k-means clustering
    kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=n_clusters, random_state=42, n_init=10)  # Added n_init
    df['cluster'] = kmeans.fit_predict(X_scaled)

    # Visualize the clusters (using two descriptors for simplicity)
    plt.scatter(df['MolWt'], df['LogP'], c=df['cluster'], cmap='viridis')
    plt.xlabel('Molecular Weight')
    plt.ylabel('LogP')
    plt.title('Compound Clusters')
    plt.show()
    ```

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Data Quality:**  Always be mindful of data quality.  Check for inconsistencies, errors, and outliers.  The `standard_value::text ~ '^[0-9\.]+$'` filter is a good start, but you might need more sophisticated cleaning.
*   **Model Interpretability:**  While complex models can achieve higher accuracy, they can be harder to interpret.  Consider using techniques like SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to understand the predictions of your models.
*   **Domain Knowledge:**  Leverage your domain knowledge to guide your analysis.  Are there specific descriptors or structural features that are known to be important for the target you are studying?
*   **Cross-Validation:** Use cross-validation techniques (e.g., k-fold cross-validation) to get a more robust estimate of your model's performance.
